\section{Introduction}
Upon consultation with Brian (I thought my initial project was trivial to accomplish), I have decided to expand the scope my project and the final goal will be to pre-configure and pre-package a ready for distribution and deployment collaborative work environment for researchers and students working with digital texts in Japanese language. The initial goal to make it easier and quicker to complete multiple dictionary look-ups will still remain a large part of the project. The expanded functionality will include annotation and collaboration functionality that would allow, for example, a research student and supervisor to annotate, markup and collaboratively communicate while working on a text from using a pre-configured digital workspace.
